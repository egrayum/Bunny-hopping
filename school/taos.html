      <h1>Taos climbing</h1>
      <p>
        The majority of the sport climbing in Taos is on basalt in a canyon a little ways southwest of town, though
        there are a few granite sport climbs at Tres Piedras and there’s some more sport climbing down by Santa Fe.
      </p>
      <h2>Utopian Vistas</h2>
      <p>
        The Utopian Vistas are a collection of hard, pocketed basalt cliffs in a canyon a medium length drive southwest
        from Taos. The grade range is mostly 10-11, with over a dozen 12’s. Over half of the climbs are sport.
      </p>
      <h2>Vista Verde</h2>
      <p>
        Vista Verde is a group of basalt cliffs just down canyon from Utopian Vista. The grade range is largely 10-12, with a couple 13’s.
        The bat cave is home to 11 overhung 2.5+ star mid-12 to low 13 routes, with a couple 11’s.
        Wayne Manor also has quite a few 2.5+ star routes, all in the 10-12 range. The cliff is mostly vertical, with a bulge halfway up.
      </p>
      <h2>Jemez Mountains</h2>
      <p>
        The Jemez Mountains are west of the Santa Fe valley, and host several areas of different rock types.
        Most of the sport climbing in the Jemez Mountains is at Las Conchas, which is a (granite?) area with
        quite a few walls in some meadows next to the Jemez River. The majority of the climbing is 10-12.
      </p>
      <h2>White Rock</h2>
      <p>
        White rock is just northwest of Santa Fe, and is mostly trad but has a couple sport walls, like Below the
        Old New Place which has a grade range of mostly 10-12 as well.
