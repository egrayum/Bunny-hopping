      <h1>A history of the US and Indigenous people</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        Indigenous peoples have been treated terribly ever since the first Europeans set foot in North America.
        When Christopher Columbus landed in North America, he burned indigenous people’s villages and took them back
        to Europe as enslaved people. When the first permanent British settlement was founded in what is now the U.S in
        1630 by Puritans, they believed the land was an untouched, pristine wilderness with maybe a few primitive people, and
        felt that their god had given them dominion over the land and its resources. However, the Indigenous population was
        over 40 million in North America, and they had made complex road networks, cities, and governments, some as sophisticated
        as modern governments. The puritans and pilgrims tried to take the the land from the indigenous people, but faced resistance.
        They used irregular warfare against indigenous people, like burning their crops and killing children and elderly people,
        and called them “servants of the devil” to justify the horrible things they were doing to them.

      <h2>Trails of Tears</h2>
      <p>
        In 1830, the United States passed the Removal Act, which let it assign tracts of land west of the Mississippi River to
        specific Indigenous tribes and nations, and make new treaties with them. In return, the Indigenous nations would cede
        their homelands to the US. After the Removal Act was passed, the US made 86 treaties with 26 indigenous nations, making
        them cede their lands to the US and forcing them to relocate to specified reservations west of the Mississippi.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Most historical sources that focus on Indigenous removals talk about “the” Trail of Tears, and refer to only the Cherokee
        Nation. However, the Removal Act initiated many Trails of Tears through many different Indigenous nations. Parts of some
        nations, like the Kickapoo, fled to Canada or Mexico. Black Hawk, a leader in the Sauk Nation, believed that their land had
        not been ceded in a lawful way. He led a group of Sauks from their reservation in what is now Iowa back to their homelands
        in present-day Illinois. The settlers there thought they were being invaded, and killed many Sauks during a 4-month period
        which is now called the Black Hawk War. <br>
      </p><br>
      <p>
        The Cherokee Nation wrote many letters to Congress, asking it to honor the previous treaties it had made with them, but they
        were unsuccessful. The forced march of the Cherokee Nation started in 1838.  What is now known as the Trail of Tears was a
        long, hard journey from the remaining Cherokee homelands in Georgia and Alabama to what is now northeastern Oklahoma.

      <br>
      <h2>NoDAPL</h2>
      <p>
        The government has been ignoring indigenous people’s official rights ever since it was created. It’s signed treaties with
        Indigenous nations, like giving them land, only to go back on them, such as taking that land and selling it. Indigenous people
        do fight against it, and take cases to the court. A big example of this recently is the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) oil pipeline.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        The original plan for the DAPL would have it going through Bismarck and crossing under several rivers. The route was moved to
        go through the Standing Rock Sioux tribe’s reservation. This would “move it away from residential water supplies.” However,
        it would cross under Lake Oahe, a major source of water for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, and also violate the 1851 Fort
        Laramie Treaty boundary. During construction, from 2016-2017, the Standing Rock Sioux tribe set up camps in the way of attempted
        construction and protested it. Saying that "the Corps effectively wrote off the tribe's concerns and ignored the pipeline’s
        impacts to sacred sites and culturally important landscapes," the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sued the USACE. Their camps and
        protests drew several thousand people from around the world to stand with them. They called themselves the Water Protectors.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        On September 3, someone posted a video of National Guard and the police letting dogs loose and encouraging them to attack some
        Water Protectors who were trying to stand in the way of construction. The dogs bit several people.
        On      October 23rd, a group of Water Protectors set up a camp on land just outside the Standing Rock Sioux reservation but inside
        the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty boundary on land they considered theirs, directly in the way of pipeline construction. On October 27th,
        police and National Guard moved in on the camp, using batons, tear gas, rubber bullets, sound cannons, which emit painfully loud sound
        blasts, and arrested over 100 people.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Indigenous people have faced attempted genocide, been officially ignored, been the target of white settlers wanting
        land for hundreds of years, and resisted. They continue to fight against their official rights being ignored and their
        reservation treaties broken today.
