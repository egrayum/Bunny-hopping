      <h3>Bad vs Good Design</h3>
      <p>
        Everything artificial is designed. Whether it’s a light switch, a lunar rover, or a government, a person or group of people made decisions about how the item or system works. If it is easy and enjoyable to use, provides good feeback, and produces good results, then it is well designed. However, if the product is frustrating to use, difficult to figure out how it is used, does not provide feedback or provides useless feedback, and has no “common sense” limiting factor (for example, an x-ray machine that produces as much radiation as it is ordered with no limit, which can lead to an accidental lethal dose has no “common sense” limiting factor) then it is a badly designed product.
      </p>
      <h3>Human Centered Design and the Action Cycle</h3>
      <p>
        To design well, the concept of Human Centered Design (HCD) needs to be kept in mind. HCD is centered around the human action cycle, which has 6 action steps, divided into 2 “gulfs”: the gulf of execution and the gulf of evaluation. The first gulf, the gulf of execution, houses the first 3 action steps: formulate a goal, planning actions and specifying a sequence for the actions, and then performing the actions. This is where figuring out how a product works happens. The second gulf, the  gulf of evaluation, is made up of the steps perceiving the state of the system or object, interpreting the perception, and comparing the outcome with the goal formulated in the first step of the first gulf. This is where reflection on what happened occurs. HCD helps *bridge* these gulfs, making the process of using a system or object faster, easier, and more enjoyable.
      </p>
      <h3>Conceptual Models</h3>
      <p>
        A well-designed object or system based on HCD conveys a useful *conceptual model* easily. Essentially, a conceptual model is a simplified mental model of how something works, and the conceptual model doesn’t even have to be complete or correct as long as it is useful. For example, folders on a computer give a conceptual model of documents in folders in, say, a filing cabinet. Different people have different conceptual models for items and systems. An electrician’s conceptual model of a light switch will be different than a normal user’s, and for more complex objects and systems there will be even more different conceptual models. One person may have a couple different conceptual models for the same thing, used for different occasions, such as fixing the thing or using the thing.
      </p>
      <h3>Design Elements</h3>
      <p>
        Conceptual models are often build from experience and a system or object’s appearance. Design elements include *affordances*, *signifiers*, and *labels.* Affordances are are things that the object or system lets the user do. For example, a clickable area on the screen affords a click there, and a chair affords a place to sit. Signifiers are signals of where or how to do something. A button rectangle on a screen signifies you can click there, while the clickable area affords the click.
        Labels say what something does. For example, the text “Submit” on a button tells you that the button submits a form that may be higher up on a webpage.
