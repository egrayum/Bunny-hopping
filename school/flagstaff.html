      <h1>Flagstaff research</h1>
      <h3>Climbing</h3>
      <p>
        There are 2 main sport areas near Flagstaff: Elden Mountain and The Pit.
        Elden Mountain is just north of flagstaff, and has many scattered, smallish walls,
        each hosting somewhere from 3-15 routes. The grade range is mostly 5.10 to 5.12,
        with a couple 13’s and the occasional easier route. There is also lots of bouldering
        scattered around the area. The rock is dacite. <br>
        <br>
        The climbing at The Pit is mostly steeper and short, and some walls are very huecoed.
        The style is pocketed and edgy, as the rock is white Kaibab limestone. It is a short
        drive southeast of Flagstaff. To quote mountain project: “Today, it’s northern Arizona’s
        prime sport area. Well, if by prime means most convenient for Flagstaff locals.” The grade
        range is 5.7 to 5.14, with most walls having a very high concentration one number grade
        from 10 to 13.<br>
        <br>
        There is also the Overlook, between Flagstaff and Sedona, which is almost all trad.
      </p>
      <h3>Hiking/Biking</h3>
      <p>
        There are 80+ trails in or very near Flagstaff on All Trails, and around 50 of them
        are dog friendly and 50 are mountain bike friendly. There are also hundreds more trails
        within a 30 minute drive of Flagstaff.
      </p>
      <h3>Groceries</h3>
      <p>
        The grocery store options in Flagstaff are your average stores in a medium sized town,
        even if there is a decently sized selection: there’s a couple Safeways, a Walmart or two,
        a Whole Foods, Fry’s, Bashas, and Sprouts.
      </p>
      <h3>Housing/Lots</h3>
      <p>
        Houses in Flagstaff are listed at $451k on average, which is up +16.5% from last year.
        Price/sqft is $246 on average, up +11.8% from last year.
        They also tend to sell for -1% list price and usually go pending in 17 days.
        Lots can have pretty good deals (I think), there are several lots on Zillow that are
        10+ acres for <$130k and have been listed for >100 days. They are several miles from Flagstaff.
        Other lots, < 2 acres, are much closer to Flagstaff and are much more expensive per acre.
      </p>
      <h3>Temps</h3>
      <p>
        The average high stays between 50˚F and 85˚F all year except for Dec, Jan, and Feb, during which
        the avg high is 44-47˚F. The highest avg. high of the year is ≈83˚F from Jun-Aug. The avg low stays
        around 30˚F below the avg high.
