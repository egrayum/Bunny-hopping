      <h2> Design</h2>
      <p>
        In 2014, Palantir got a contract from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to make a database for keeping
        track of immigrants. Palantir built the database, and it was built by designers who knew who and what it was for.
        Starting in 2019, as a result of that, ICE is keeping immigrants in cages, some of which are infants that have been
        separated from their parents!
        In Ruined by Design, Mike Montiero uses this example and many others to show us that the world is a disaster.
         He also talks about how we just might be able to fix it. Below, we take a look at some of the ways we can do our best to fix it.
        Just because you don’t have “designer” in your title doesn’t mean that you aren’t a designer. Everyone
        who makes a decision in the designing process of a system is a designer. Everyone who has any amount of influence on the final product is a designer.
        Designers are not “pixel pushers”, they are gatekeepers, and they have not been guarding their gates.
        The world was designed to be a mess, and the biggest destructive forces are systems and platforms made and run by
        white guys, like Twitter and Uber, which are eventually (or sometimes from the very start) designed or run in a way that
         only benefits themselves. Example: Twitter doesn’t ban white supremacists that break their rules because they “create
         engagement”, and Twitter profits from engagement.
        How can we design the systems we use every day to be secure, easy to use, and work for the user, not the maker?

      <h2> Veil of Ignorance</h2>
      <p>
        Proposed by philosopher John Rawls in 1971, one way to design better, more just systems and determine
        the ethics of them is to design under a “veil of ignorance”. What this means to design a system from the
        point of view of someone not knowing what their relationship to the system will be until it is already designed.
         Say that someone is designing a system of government that allows slavery. They could be enslaved.
        Also, design from different viewpoints.
      </p>
      <h2> Designers are Gatekeepers</h2>
      <p>
        When someone tells a designer what thing they want to be designed, they need to ask questions about it,
        and get involved in the design process.
        A designer needs to be able to ask why and say no. To quote Ruined by Design, “at some point, someone is going
        to have to stand on front of someone who can fire them and stop them from doing something stupid. That’s the day
        they actually become a designer.” Designing something takes a lot of collaboration between different people with different skills.
        It takes engineers, strategists, developers, and more- they’re all designers.
      </p>
      <h2> Design Education</h2>
      <p>
        Design education is a wreck. It doesn’t teach how to be a designer. It doesn’t teach any of the skills designers need.
        Design education doesn’t teach designers ethics. That needs to change. We need design schools that teach how to present
        work, how to work ethically, how to ask questions, and what questions to ask. Design schools need to teach designers to
         be able to say no, and to not be a pixel pusher, but rather a gatekeeper.
        New designers from design schools are being hired straight into companies like Facebook, where the biggest decisions are
        being made. They don’t have the skills or experience to handle decisions that affect billions of people. New designers should
        demand a complete education and design educators need to update their curriculum.

      <h2> Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Microsoft designed face-recognition software. When Microsoft employees found out that Microsoft had
        subcontracted ICE on it, they were aghast and made a petition to kill the contract, along with 300,000 signatures,
        of which were 500 Microsoft employees. They were successful. Microsoft has 135,000 employees, so it took less than 1% of
        the employees at Microsoft to make a difference!
