      <h1>So Good They Can’t Ignore You</h1>
      <p>
        This report is based on and talks about the ideas in Cal Newport’s book So Good They Can’t Ignore You.
      </p>
      <h2>Don’t Follow Your Passion</h2>
      <p>
        The most commonly given advice for finding a career you like is “Follow your passion.” However, this career advice is bad and can sometimes be dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pre-existing passions aren’t extremely common in the first place, and even if you do have a pre-existing passion, there’s only a very small chance that it’s related to a career at all. A study in 2002 done on 539 Canadian university students found out that 84% of them had pre-existing passions, but only 4% of those passions were related to work at all. The rest were hobbies, like sports or art. 
        This career advice can also be dangerous, because if you feel like you haven’t found the “right work” then it can make you to hop from job to job, hoping to find your passion. This can cause extreme self doubt and unhappiness.
      </p>
      <h2>Become a Craftsman</h2>
      <p>
        So, following your passion is not something you should do when looking for good work. What should you do instead?
      </p>
      <p>
        The “Passion mindset” is when you focus on what the world has to offer you.
        You will find and make better work when you switch to the “Craftsman mindset”, which is when you focus on what you can offer the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people who have been at their work for a long time will tell you that they do love their careers, even if they didn’t at the start. This is because passion is a side effect of mastery.
      </p>
      <p>
        After you adopt the craftsman mindset, the next step is focusing on becoming so good they can’t ignore you - practice and acquire “career capital”, which is rare and valuable skills. Once you build up enough career capital, you can “trade it in” for traits that make a good job.
      </p>
      <h2>Control Traps</h2>
      <p>
        Three main characteristics define good work: Creative work, Impactful work, and, most of all, Control over your schedule and life.
        There are 2 “Control traps” that you may fall into while trying to get more control.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first control trap to be wary of is when you try to get more control without enough career capital. Getting more control without career capital to back it up is not sustainable; you need to build up rare and valuable skills, and then offer them in exchange for more control. Any attempt to gain control with no career capital to offer in return is doomed to fail.
        A great example of falling into this control trap is Jane. Understanding the impact of control, she graduated from college with a more adventurous, control-filled life plan than simply following a path into a well-paying job. Her plan vaguely states “build a set of low-maintenance websites that earn enough to support adventurous pursuits,” the pursuits containing  “survive in the woods for 1 month with no tools or equipment,” circumnavigate the world’s oceans, travel across each continent without motor power (“Australia by unicycle?… Antarctica by dogsled?”), and learning to become a fire breather. Eventually, her plan said to
        “develop a non-profit to develop a vision of health, human potential, and a life well lived.”
        Jane recognized that obtaining more control over your life is better than getting more income or prestige. However, she had nothing to offer in return for money and her control-filled life vision, no career capital to trade in. All of the freelance and blog projects she started, she lost motivation in before any real results came in. One of the projects, a blog she was hoping was going to become her main revenue generator, only featured 3 blog posts in 9 months. To quote Cal Newport: “A commitment to dog sledding across Antartica, it turns out, doesn’t read well on a resume.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The second control trap is that as soon as you get enough career capital to trade in for more control, you will become valuable enough that your employer will start to resist giving you more control.
      </p>
      <p>
        To avoid falling into these traps, follow what Cal Newport calls the “Law of Financial Viability”:
        If there is evidence of people willing to pay for a pursuit to introduce more control into your life, then continue with it. Otherwise, leave it for when you have more career capital.
      </p>
      <h2>Missions</h2>
      <p>
        The biggest part of a meaningful career is a mission. A good mission can fulfill the other two characteristics of good work: creative work and impactful work. It could be anything from ridding the world of ancient diseases to popularizing archaeology. However, you shouldn’t just pick a mission immediately and start working toward it. You need career capital to get and pursue an interesting mission. A good career mission is similar to a scientific breakthrough, only when you have
        reached the cutting edge of your field do you have interesting mission opportunities. You also need a strategy to set your mission in motion - you can’t just “sell everything and go.” The best way to do this is with “little bets” - small investments of time, energy and resources that take less than a month to do. Some will fail, and some will succeed, but you’ll be constantly getting feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, take Kirk French and his mission to popularize archaeology. It’s hard to take the leap from theory to practice, but Kirk did it very well. As a graduate student, he specialized in Mayan water management and got interviewed for a documentary Lost Worlds for the History Channel about the Maya. This solidified a potential mission for his career: popularize modern archaeology. After he graduated with a PhD, he started a couple projects centered around the 1961 documentary Land and Water: An Ecological Study of the Teotihuacan Valley of Mexico. He managed to obtain the original 16 mm reels, including parts that didn’t make the original cut. One of the projects was to digitize the original footage release a DVD of the original documentary. The second, more ambitious project was to film a new documentary that included the changes that had happened since the 1960s. Kirk’s mission breakthrough happened in December 2009, not too long after starting the two previous projects, when he heard a voicemail of someone who thought they had the treasure of the Knights Templar in his backyard. In a field like archaeology, you get a lot of calls like this - “people who think they found a dinosaur footprint, or whatever” - and there’s usually not time to keep up wit them. But Kirk saw an opportunity that would help his mission. “This type of public outreach is exactly what we archaeologists should be doing,” he said. He decided to follow up on each of these types of calls, visiting them, filming it, and eventually making a documentary on the most interesting case. He decided to call it Armchair Archaeologist, and expected it to take somewhere from 5 to 10 years, something to work on next to his filming project in the Teotihuacan Valley. Around this time, the Discovery Channel decided it wanted a show that had something to do with archaeology. It spread work of general interest to a few production companies and let them figure out the details. A couple months after Kirk filmed his first Armchair Archaeologist footage, a production company reached out to the head of the Penn State archaeology department, who forwarded the message to the entire staff. Kirk followed up with the production company, and sent them his Armchair Archaeologist footage. The production loved the idea and they loved Kirk. They sent a refilmed tape to the Discovery Channel, who said “Let’s film 8 episodes.” Kirk got his good fried Jason de Leon to cohost, and they arranged for the Discovery Channel to buy out their teaching responsibilities at Penn State, and they hit the road for the first season of what was to become American Treasures.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        To summarize: “Follow your passion” is bad and sometimes dangerous job advice, which you shouldn’t follow. Instead, you should build up rare and valuable skills, “career capital,” to trade in for traits that define good work. There are 2 traps to avoid while seeking more control, and missions are a big part of a good career, but most interesting ones are only possible when you have gained lots of career capital and reached the cutting edge of your field. Missions also require “little bets” to set into action.
