    <h2>
      So good they can’t ignore you
    </h2>
    <p>
      This report is based on and talks about the ideas in Cal Newport’s book So Good they Can’t Ignore you.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Don’t Follow your Passion
    </h3>
    <p>
      The most commonly given advice for finding a job you like is “Follow your passion.” However, this job advice is bad and
      can sometimes be dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pre-existing passions aren’t extremely common in the first place, and even if you do have a pre-existing passion, there’s
      only a very small chance that it’s related to a job at all. A study in 2002 done on 539 Canadian university students found
      out that 84% of them had pre-existing passions, but only 4% of those passions were related to jobs at all. The rest were hobbies, like sports or art. 
      This job advice can also be dangerous, because if you feel like you haven’t found the “right job” then it can make you to hop from
      job to job, hoping to find your passion. This can cause extreme self doubt and unhappiness.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Become a Craftsman
    </h3>
    <p>
      So, following your passion is not something you should do when looking for a good job. What should you do instead?
    </p>
    <p>
      The “Passion mindset” is when you focus on what the world has to offer you.
      You will find and make better work when you switch to the “Craftsman mindset”, which is when you focus on what you can offer the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people who have been at their jobs for a long time will tell you that they do love their jobs, even if they didn’t at
      the start. This is because passion is a side effect of mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you adopt the craftsman mindset, the next step is focusing on becoming so good they can’t ignore you - practice and
      acquire “career capital”, which is rare and valuable skills. Once you build up enough career capital, you can “trade it in”
      for traits that make a good job.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Control traps
    </h3>
    <p>
      Three main characteristics define good work: Creative work, Impactful work, and, most of all, Control over your schedule and life.
      There are 2 “Control traps” that you may fall into while trying to get more control.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first control trap to be wary of is when you try to get more control without enough career capital. Getting more control
      without career capital to back it up is not sustainable; you need to build up rare and valuable skills, and then offer them
      in exchange for more control. Any attempt to gain control with no career capital to offer in return is doomed to fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second control trap is that as soon as you get enough career capital to trade in for more control, you will become valuable
      enough that your employer will start to resist giving you more control.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid falling into these traps, follow what Cal Newport calls the “Law of Financial Viability”:
      If there is evidence of people willing to pay for a pursuit to introduce more control into your life, than continue with it.
      Otherwise, leave it for when you have more career capital.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Missions
    </h3>
    <p>
      The biggest part of a meaningful career is a mission. A good mission can fulfill the other two characteristics of good work:
      creative work and impactful work. It could be anything from ridding the world of ancient diseases to popularizing archaeology.
      However, you shouldn’t just pick a mission immediately and start working toward it. You need career capital to get and pursue
      and interesting mission. A good career mission is similar to a scientific breakthrough, only when you have reached the cutting
      edge of your field do you have interesting mission opportunities. You also need a strategy to set your mission in motion - you
      can’t just “sell everything and go.” The best way to do this is with “little bets” - small investments of time, energy and resources
      that take less than a month to do. Some will fail, and some will succeed, but you’ll be constantly getting feedback.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Summary
    </h3>
    <p>
      “Follow your passion” is bad and sometimes dangerous job advice, which you shouldn’t follow. Instead, you should build up rare and
      valuable skills, “career capital,” to trade in for traits that define good work. There are 2 traps to avoid while seeking more control,
      and missions are a big part of a good career, but most interesting ones are only possible when you have gained lots of career capital
      and reached the cutting edge of your field. Missions also require “little bets” to set into action.
